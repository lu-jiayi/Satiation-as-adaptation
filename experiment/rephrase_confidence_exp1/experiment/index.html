  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>In this experiment, you will be reading English sentences. On each slide, you will see a context sentence and a target sentence. Some of the target sentences may sound a bit awkward. <b>Your job is to rephrase the target sentence base on your interpretation. </b></p>
  <p>You will also be asked to <b>rate your confidence in your rephrasing</b>. That is, how confident you are that your answer reflects the intended meaning of the target sentence.</p>

    <p>In this case, the target sentence is asking what the boy saw on the table. One possible rephrasing would be: <b>What is the thing that the boy saw on the table?</b> </p>
    <p>Of course, there can be other ways to rephrase it. If you are confident that your rephrasing reflects the intended meaning of the target, you should drag the slider bar to the right. If not, drag the slider bar to the left.</p>

    <p>This target sentence sounds a bit awkward. It is intending to ask who slept under the bridge. One way to rephrase it would be <b>Who slept under the bridge?</b>.</p>
    <p>Of course, there can be other ways to rephrase it. If you are confident that your rephrasing reflects the intended meaning of the target, you should drag the slider bar to the right. If not, drag the slider bar to the left.</p>

    <p>Before we start the experiment, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
    <p>(1) Please make sure you read <b>both</b> the context sentence and the target sentence carefully. If the target sentence sounds awkward, try your best to interpret its intended meaning.</p>
    <p>(2) Please rephrase <b>only</b> the target sentence by typing into the text box.</p>
    <p>(3) Use the slider bar to indicate how confident you are about your rephrasing correctly reflecting the intended meaning of the target sentence.</p>
